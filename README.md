Hi astronauts!

Houston here, the objectives of this mission are for you to zip your way across vast emptiness to the "nearest" galaxy and speak to our intelligent alien neighbours about lending us some brains 'cause there's bugger-all down here on earth! 
You could offer them some tasty space food as a bargaining chip and maybe throw in some coffee to seal the deal.
